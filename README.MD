# Python Practices

Everything I do for learning Python. 
Initiating since 7th April 2021.

## 7th April, 2021. 
1. Today, I am trying to pair Github.com repo with my local PyCharm.
2. Move the practices of PySimpleGUI module into a package - simplyGUI, and sync it to Github.   

## 3rd Feb., 2022.
1. initialize data-structure-and-algorithms folder.
2. add BTree, Kruskals MST in tree-and-graph.
3. add primers in generator.
4. add 8queens, permutation, combination in recursion.

## 4th Feb., 2022.
1. add Kruskals Minimum Spanning Tree in tree-and-graph.
2. adopt a new method for checking loops when applying Kruskals MST.

## 5th Feb., 2022.
1. add Prim's MST in tree-and-graph.
2. add Dijkstra shortest path in tree-and-graph.
3. add breadth-first-search and depth-first-search in tree-and-graph.

## 9th Feb., 2022
1. add Betweeness Centrality
2. add PageRank

## 10th Feb., 2022
